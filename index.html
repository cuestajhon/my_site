      <h2>Hello!</h2>
      <p>
      <p>I'm an Educator, Instructional Technologist, and Lifelong Learner. I got my PhD in Second Language Acquisition and Instructional Technology in 2019. It is a long program name but it simply means that I am interested in how languages are learned and even
        better, how we can take advantage of technology to enhance learning and teaching processes. I studied and worked in the US for 10 years and I now live with my beautiful family in beautiful Germany. In this site you will find a bit more about myself. For comments or complaints, please contact my wife ;) JK, please do not hesitate to reach out at anytime.</p>
