      <h2>Hello!</h2>
      <p>
      <p>I'm an Educator, Instructional Technologist, and Lifelong Learner. I have a PhD in Second Language Acquisition and Instructional Technology. It is a fancy name but it simply means that I am interested in how languages are learned and even
        better, how we can take advantage of technology to enhance learning and teaching processes. I lived in the US for 10 years and I just moved to Germany in search of new opportunities. That being said, if you happen to know of a place in which
        I can apply my skills as educator, researcher, advisor, team member, lifelong learner, do not hesitate to contact me.</p>
